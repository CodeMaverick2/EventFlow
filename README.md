# EventFlow

**EventFlow** is a real-time flow simulation and tracking system that allows you to visualize the execution of a series of events (such as sending emails, waiting, and handling renewals) through a node-based chart. The application allows users to start a simulation, view logs, and monitor the progression of events in real-time. It uses React and React Flow for the frontend and Node.js for the backend to simulate the flow, with MongoDB used to store logs of the flow.

**DEMO** - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UVxYUxQZhmv796t_dammleg6rmGpKvr4/view?usp=sharing
## Features

- Real-time flow visualization with nodes representing different events.
- Logs are displayed in real-time as the flow progresses.
- Node colors change dynamically based on flow events (e.g., flow completion, renewals).
- Clear separation between frontend and backend with seamless communication.

## Assumptions Made

- **Event Flow:** The flow consists of a series of events such as sending emails and waiting for responses. Events like email sending, waiting, and subscription renewal are simulated.
- **Backend Simulation:** The backend simulates the event flow and sends real-time logs via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **MongoDB Integration:** Flow logs are stored in MongoDB, allowing persistence of events that occur during flow simulation.
- **React Flow:** The visualization is built using React Flow, with a node-based UI to represent each step of the flow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (or a cloud-based MongoDB service like Atlas)
- React
- Express.js
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) setup for communication between frontend and backend




### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeMaverick2/EventFlow.git
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   Then install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install express cors mongodb dotenv
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
   Then install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom react-flow-renderer axios react-scripts
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root folder (next to the backend and frontend directories) and add the following:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas).

5. **Run the Project:**

   Start the backend and frontend servers:

   ```bash
   # In the backend directory
   npm start

   # In the frontend directory
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend:**  
   The frontend uses React Flow to create and display a series of nodes representing each event in the flow (such as "Start Flow", "First Mail Sent", etc.). As the user starts the flow simulation, the frontend listens for updates from the backend and dynamically updates the flow chart based on the current state.

2. **Backend:**  
   The backend simulates a flow by sending log messages through a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint. These logs are saved in MongoDB for persistence and sent to the frontend in real-time, updating the flow chart and logs displayed to the user.

3. **MongoDB Logging:**  
   Every log message generated by the flow (such as "First Mail Sent", "3 Days Wait Ended", etc.) is saved in the MongoDB database. This enables you to maintain a history of all flow events.

## Conclusion

**EventFlow** is a comprehensive solution for simulating and visualizing event flows. It provides a real-time view of the progression of events in a flow, with the added benefit of persistent logging and dynamic node updates. The integration of React Flow for visualization and MongoDB for logging makes it a scalable and efficient system for flow tracking.
